Hello,
In this depository I've posted 4 programs that have all been written in C++. I've listed the names and descriptions of those four projects below:
\
\
\
 ** 1. Bank Branch Program (Folder) ** \
 \
         - A program where it reads in a file containing user information and prompts the current user for their pin in order to match records within the file.
         Based on the user's input, the program determines if the user is authenticated. If the user is authenticated, they will be allowed to access, withdraw
         from, or deposit into their bank account. If the user is not authenticated, they are allowed 3 tries before the program will exit.
 
 
 ** 2. sixteen_2048 Program (Folder) **
        - A puzzle game where you combine numbered tiles with the same value in order to gain a higher numbered tile, inspired by the game "2048". The program
          was originally made to stop once the numnber "16" has been reached, but it has since been modified to stop at "128".
          
 
 ** 3. Perfect Invariants Project (.cpp file) **
        - A program that finds perfect digital invariants that are within the range from 10,000 to 99,999. 
          For further explanation, a perfect digital invaraint is a number in a given number base b that is the sum of its own digits each raised to a given power
          p. For example, 4,150 == 4^5 + 1^5 + 5^5 + 0^5.


 ** 5. Stars and Binary Numbers Project (.cpp file) **
        - This program is split into two parts. The first half of this program uses functions to print out an amount of stars (*) recursively based on the user's
          input. The 2nd half of the program utilizes a stack to convert the user's choice of an integer into a binary number. 


The first two projects are folders containing makefiles, while the third and fourth projects are .cpp files. For further explanation on each project, you'll 
find that I've commented elaborately on each .cpp file for a better understanding. 
  
  
  
  Thanks for stopping by!\
